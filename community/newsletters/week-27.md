Hello to our first edition of Jupiter Project newsletter! This week we worked on:

* KuCoin migration plan
* Jupiter v3.0 [validator](../../jupiter-3.0/testnet-validator-guide-linux.md) and installation guides
  * Installation validation started on Raspberry Pi ([Metis Container](https://sigwo.com/products/metis-container/))
* Partner project development&#x20;
* Updated [farm](../../how-to-guides/farming/) guides

Shoutout to our man Rory MacDonald for qualifying for the PFL Playoffs this past weekend! Rocking that JUPITER gear :rocket:

This week we are working on securing the launch date for Jupiter v3.0 and the roadmap to get us to the [IBC](https://ibcprotocol.org/). We are also working towards partnerships and revenue models to announce for continued Jupiter Project growth and adoption. Stay tuned!&#x20;
