# Staking on Jupiter

### To bridge from ETH to the Jupiter mainnet:

1. Purchase JUP on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x4b1e80cac91e2216eeb63e29b957eb91ae9c2be8\&outputCurrency=ETH) or [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/ucenter/signup?rcode=HH7M58). Ensure the [$JUP](https://etherscan.io/token/0x4B1E80cAC91e2216EEb63e29B957eB91Ae9C2Be8) are in your Metamask wallet.
2. If you have Chrome or Brave browser, consider installing [Europa](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jupiter-europa/gafpmgjlgaocgmlggjbpjmpedlebgnej) to ease access to your Jupiter mainnet assets and coins. Create an account on the extension or [here](https://nodes.jup.io). The Jupiter mainnet addresses are formatted as this `JUP-T7WC-WHHT-T48V-3KZ5Z`.
3. Go to [https://swap.jup.io](https://swap.jup.io) and connect both your Metamask and Europa extensions.&#x20;
4. Ensure you select "ETH (ERC20)" and "JUP (MAINNET)" accordingly.&#x20;
5. Enter the amount you want to swap from ERC20 to Jupiter Mainnet, click "Swap"
6. Approve the transaction, minding the ETH gas fee. DO NOT SPEED THE TRANSACTION UP! If you do, the swap will not automatically complete.
7. In about 5 minutes, you will have JUP in your Europa account. You can log into the wallet at https://nodes.jup.io and complete the following task to obtain $FORGE to earn rewards.![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-11-12 at 10.39.53 PM.png>)

### Buy $FORGE on Jupiter

1. Open the web wallet. Using your `JUP-` address, log into the wallet.
2. Click 'Asset Exchange' on the left menu. Then, click 'Add Asset' in the top right corner.
3. Paste in the asset ID for FORGE, `15210174725739850610` then click 'Add Asset'.
4. In the 'Buy FORGE with JUP' area, click the green `+` button. This will expand the fields to fill out.
5. Input how many $FORGE you want to purchase, remembering you need to keep a small amount for transaction fees. 0.1 JUP will be plenty.
6. ENSURE THE PRICE IS 1 JUP EACH! Then click the 'Buy (JUP -> FORGE)' button.
7. Enter your passphrase. Click 'OK'. In 30 seconds you will have $FORGE in your wallet and every hour you will collect rewards.
8. $FORGE is always pegged 1:1 JUP:FORGE. NEVER sell your FORGE for less than 1 JUP! You simply put your sell order and the market bot will come buy it. The bot sweeps all sells at 1 JUP every 10-15 minutes.
