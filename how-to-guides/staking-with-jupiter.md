# Staking with Jupiter

### To bridge from JUP to BSC bwJUP:

1. Purchase JUP on [Pancakeswap](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?inputCurrency=0x0231f91e02debd20345ae8ab7d71a41f8e140ce7\&outputCurrency=0xbb4cdb9cbd36b01bd1cbaebf2de08d9173bc095c), [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x4b1e80cac91e2216eeb63e29b957eb91ae9c2be8\&outputCurrency=ETH), or [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/ucenter/signup?rcode=HH7M58).&#x20;
2. **KuCoin is our official network bridging partner. We have also partnered with** [**multichain.org**](https://app.multichain.org/#/router) **for ERC20 <=> BEP20 versions of Jupiter. The old swap.jup.io site is deprecated and offline.**&#x20;
3. Ensure you select "ETH (ERC20)", BSC (BEP20), or "Jupiter (JUP)" accordingly. To stake at [OKLG](https://app.oklg.io/#/faas) and look for `BWJUP` for the single-sided staking (SSS) farm.
4. Click the green `+/-` button and input the amount you would like to stake.&#x20;
5. The first time you interact with the farm, you will have to `approve` the transaction and then `stake` the deposit. This is normal interaction with EVM-style chains.
6. The SSS farm has a 1-day lock in period. After 1 day, you will see a blue button appear. This button harvests your rewards and leaves your stake in the farm. If you want to add your harvest to the stake, click the green `+/-` button and complete step 5.
