# Farming - bwJUP/USDO

### Setup Metamask

1. Open Metamask
2. Add bwJUP token - 0x0231f91e02DebD20345Ae8AB7D71A41f8E140cE7
3. Add USDO token - 0x5801d0e1c7d977d78e4890880b8e579eb4943276

![Note: If you have added certain tokens before and don’t see them in Metamask, simply go through the process of Importing Tokens and they will reappear.](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

1. Click Import tokens at the bottom
2. Input the token address from above
3. Click Add Custom Token
4. If you have already added one of these previously Click on Import Tokens and it will import the specific tokens that already exist in your Metamask wallet.&#x20;

### Buy BNB and JUP

1. Go to Kucoin and purchase $BNB and $JUP
2. If this is your first time purchasing a crypto currency, you will need to hold $USDT in order to purchase  $BNB or $JUP. Therefore, you must purchase $USDT
3. Click on Buy Crypto (this can be found on the main screen on mobile, while you will need to navigate to the Assets page on desktop
4. Choose FastBuy, P2P, OR Third-Party
5. If this is your first time purchasing through Kucoin, they will walk you through KYC verification steps and it will take some time for that to get completed, so be patient.  It can take a few days.
6. If you have purchased before, consider Fast Buy as Kucoin handles the transaction directly and there are less fees associated and it clears immediately
7. Choose USDT as your desired currency to purchase and the amount of money you wish to spend in your currency denomination (U.S. Dollar in my case).
8. Once you have USDT you can purchase $BNB and $JUP in whatever quantity you desire (You will need a LOT more $JUP than $BNB (for instance, you can purchase about 3000 – 4000 $JUP and about $80 - $85 U.S. Dollars worth of $BNB and that should allow you to start farming well)&#x20;

_NOTE: The $JUP and US Dollar figures are illustrative purposes only to illustrate the proportion of $JUP to $BNB and this is not an exact figure or recommendation_

### Next Step, withdraw from KuCoin!

_**The coins you wish to withdraw MUST be in the Main Account. They cannot be in Trading or other accounts on KuCoin.**_&#x20;

1. Choose the coin you wish to withdraw, Click Withdraw
2. Open Metamask extension or browser page
3. Copy the Metamask address (top Middle in Metamask)
4. Paste that address in the Wallet Address: box in KuCoin
5. Choose BEP20(BSC) as the Network in the Network dropdown
6. Choose the amount of that coin you want to withdraw – Click Max if you want to withdraw all
7. Input any Remarks (not required)
8. Click Confirm Button at the bottom
9. Wait 3-5 minutes for your coins to show up in Metamask

**\*\*Make 100% sure you have pasted the Metamask address correctly – this goes for all addresses you use now and in the future. . . ALWAYS double check it is correct – The wrong address can mean lost funds and no one can get them back for you\*\***

_Note: When you transfer $JUP to Metamask as BEP20(BSC) it is bwJUP. There is no conversion or steps to take. $JUP is bwJUP._
