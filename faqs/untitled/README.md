## What is Metis?

Metis is a messaging application based on blockchain technology. Each message is represented as an encrypted transaction on the Jupiter blockchain. Metis is a distributed service that runs on a decentralized blockchain network to provide a higher level of security, privacy, and independence from any authority. Anyone can run Metis on their own hardware, yet still talk to the entire global Metis network and distributed infrastructure.

## How are messages encrypted in Metis?

The messages are double-encrypted. First, by the blockchain protocol \(Curve25519 – same as Monero, Polkadot or Solana, as well as others\), which is decrypted with your passphrase \(12-word private key to access your account in the Jupiter network\) and second, a layer in the Metis application itself that communicates with the blockchain, with military grade encryption \(AES256-cbc\), decrypted with your encryption password in the application.

Logging into the Metis application takes both the passphrase and encryption password. You may set your login to use your mobile devices' built-in biometric feature to ease login and use.

Only people inside a channel can read the messages in that channel –and channels are only accessed by the invitation of another member.
